             * Ritlin says. The group looks at you with eyes widening and mouths agape. Ritlin turns back to you and continues, "I haven't see nor heard tell of anybody
             * who can wield that power in a million clock cycles of the CPU. Nobody has been able to do that since the Uncoded One showed up in these lands." He describes
             * the shadowy and mysterious Uncoded One, an evil power that rots programs and perhaps even the world itself. The Uncoded One's presence has prevented anybody
             * from wielding the power of programming, the only thing that might be able to stop it. Yet somehow, you have been able to grab hold of this power anyway. Ritlin's
             * companions suddenly seem doubtful. "Can you show them what you showed me? Use some of that Programming of yours to make a program? Make something with more than
             * one statement in it?"
             * 
             * Objective: 
             * Make a program with 5 Console.WriteLine statments in it?"
